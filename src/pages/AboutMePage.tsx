          we are

          I was born and raised in Hong Kong and relocated to London in August
          2019. I am an adventurous person and always willing to take risks to
          challenge myself.
        </p>

          Last year, I decided to learn web development, a subject that I have
          always been interested in and looking for an opportunity to change my
          career after 10 years in the advertising business.

          Now that I have finished my boot camp, I’m very excited and eager to
          dive into the new industry. While looking into new opportunities, I’m
          also in parallel practising TypeScript and React Native, and
          revisiting my previous projects to improve my works.
